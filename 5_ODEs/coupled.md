# Coupled Differential Equations












## Implementing in your program

We wish to pass the set of coupled differential equations as a function argument. Here is how we might do it:

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} MATLAB
```matlab

[x,t]=RK4(f)
```
:::
:::{tab-item} Python
```python

???
```
:::
:::{tab-item} Julia
```julia

???
```
