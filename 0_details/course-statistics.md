# Course Statistics

Added (1) for those interested, (2) as examples of (hopefully) well-prepared plots, (3) to be transparent regarding the data that may be used to shift course structure, and (4) to emphasize quantitatively that this is a learning community that will not work as well if we are not all participating.

Looking better!




Leaving this for now...

Taking the Newton-Raphson video as an example: The following plot describes the percentage of students ($y$-axis) who watched at least $x$% of the video ($x$-axis).

So: less than half of the class opened the video. Of the 67 students who opened the video, only 40 watched the entire video. That is: only 28% of the students enrolled in MCEN 3030 watched the entire video.
