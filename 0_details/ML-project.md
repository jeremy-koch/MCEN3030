# Machine Learning Project (Preview)

**Author:** Jeremy Koch<sup>1,2</sup> \

## Introduction

Machine learning is a topic that we could spend an entire semester on it -- there is indeed a class on it offered by our department in the fall semester. We are going to get a taste of it in this course.


One of my goals for this project is to give you experience in a "hot" topic that will boost your chances of . I 
:::{warning}
We are not going to be able to.

It is a VERY authentic experience to read and modify [tutorials](https://www.mathworks.com/solutions/machine-learning.html) [tutorials](https://scikit-learn.org/1.4/tutorial/index.html) [tutorials](https://github.com/FluxML/model-zoo)

## Requirements



- AI use is encouraged for the project -- it will allow us to tackle . I have used the free versions of LLMs to assist with writing ML code -- you shouldn't have to pay either, though note that if you try to do the project in one day you will hit the daily limits.
- One limitation: you cannot feed the AI your data and ask for an analysis. You can prompt the AI with a description of the problem,
:::{aside}
A prompt I wrote recently: "I am trying to write a model that will predict the number of students enrolled in our department's courses in future semesters. I have anonymized records of many student's classes for the past several semesters to train a machine learning model. Students do not follow the exact same schedule, so there will be some probability involved. I don't need the specific courses for an individual student -- I am more interested in predicting the total number of students in the courses next semester. If possible, I would like to include prerequisites and corequisites." I'll be honest, that project is not going great...

- At various stages you will be asked to submit your prompting history. There are a few reasons we are interested in this, one is this: 
- Modifying a published tutorial, with citation, to apply to a different problem is not plagiarism -- that is almost the point of the tutorials. Using AI will not be treated as plagiarism, though there are reasonable arguments that it is plagiarism buried beneath statistics (we will ignore that philosophical discussion). However, finding a data set and analysis online and copying it is plagiarism, and will be treated with seriousness: an immediate failing grade IN THE COURSE and a report to the Honor Council. I do not care if you have 100% in every other aspect of the course, you receive an F in MCEN 3030 if you plagiarize this project.


## Deliverables

- First: a topic, and how you will obtain the data.
- You will submit 

- You will create a brief, 5 minute presentation, delivered to your lab section.
