# Course Policies

<!-- **Author:** Jeremy Koch -->

For more details about course policy, see the official course syllabus on Canvas.

:::{attention}
This document, and the course syllabus, cannot outline explicit policies for every eventuality. I reserve the right to modify any course policy in response to significant events over the semester. This could include, but is not limited to: excessive class cancellations due to weather or pandemic, changes in the accessibility of AI tools (e.g. if free versions disappear), widespread academic dishonesty, students not making effective use of class time, etc.

Keep in mind, your success is my success, and so you should have nothing to worry about if you approach this class earnestly.

## Grade Breakdown

10% in-class problems  
15% homework repository  
 5% ML project  
20% midterm 1  
20% midterm 2  
30% final exam  

---

**in-class problems:**

These will be completed in groups of three towards the beginning of each class period and will be mostly tech-free. An example problem is: compute the first two iterations of an algorithm by hand. The goal is for you to get a feel for how the algorithm works, which will allow you to better understand how to translate it to code. Further, it will give you a check to see if your code is working: in the above case, an ```if iteration==2, print x``` within your loop might be a good thing to check out.

Bigger picture: These points represent your active participation in discussions with your colleagues, which I believe is the most productive way to learn the course material. Submission will occur before the end of the class period. There will be no option to submit these late -- if you missed the class discussion, you missed the learning opportunity and will not receive credit for it. However, we will drop a small number of these assignments, likely 4, in the final grade calculation, and so you will not be penalized if you miss a small number of classes due to illness, travel, or a need to temporarily prioritize another course (which I don't approve of, but it's your call). I do not recommend trying to be strategic with these absences -- save them for when you are sick.


---

**homework repository:**

Over the course of the semester we will learn 25-30 computational ideas. Implementing these ideas as functions/scripts will be your homework, to be submitted via GitHub Classroom (mimicking the development of an actual code repository).

We will usually have the opportunity to begin this work in the classroom where your colleagues, a TA, or myself will be around to help you talk through your ideas. However...
:::{warning}
The instructional staff can see when GitHub commits occur, and will pay attention to the number that are occurring at the end of class periods. If we see that the two sections are not making use of the in-class time, as evidenced by a low percentage of students committing something by the end of class, we will eliminate this working opportunity and replace it with additional in-class problems or lecture content.

<!-- We will additionally monitor the commit history over the course of the semester. A student who consistently submits one (perfect) version of the code shortly before the deadline is almost certainly misusing AI -->



---

**machine learning project:**

We will get some authentic experience in doing a machine learning calculation. We will briefly introduce the topic, describing some of the strategies but not necessarily diving deeply into the math. MATLAB has a machine learning toolbox, Python has several packages and has the most robust machine learning community (Scikit-learn is my recommendation, but PyTorch and TensorFlow are out there too), Julia has Lux and Flux.

AI use is encouraged, tutorial use is encouraged, but plagiarism is not. An example of plagiarism in this context is: taking someone's completed analysis published in a blog somewhere and submitting it as your own work. Plagiarism in this course is completely unacceptable and will lead to immediate failing grade for the course and submission to the honor council, regardless of your grade in the other aspects of the course.

There may be intermediate milestones such as submitting a topic for approval and your LLM prompting. More details will be posted.

**exams:**

This course will have three exams -- two midterms that will occur during class, and a final exam scheduled by the university. The midterms are [tentatively scheduled](course-schedule.md) and the [final exam time](https://www.colorado.edu/registrar/students/calendar/finals) is cemented by the university before the academic year even begins.

The exams will be entirely pencil-and-paper, no electronics (including calculators). You will be allowed a small set of notes (specifics on this added later). The most important aspect of these notes will be the inputs, outputs, and descriptions of the functions you have written this semester.

Exam questions will likely be something like: achieve a task by doing the necessary setup work (e.g., defining an array of equally spaced values), calling a function, and post-processing the results. It will not be made explicit what function to call -- you will make that judgment based on your understanding of the function inputs, outputs, and limitations. There may be some additional types of questions, I might add some details later.

The final exam will be cumulative.




## Professionalism

In the past year, have observed an uptick in emails that indicate students are not paying attention to course policies and/or that students believe that course policies should not apply to them. Policies are only policies if they apply to the entire class.

I am glad to receive emails from you in general, don't be discouraged to send them to me, but I would like you to think twice before:
- ... sending an email with just "question" (or something similar) in the subject line. See [how to write emails for this class](pro-emails.md).
- ... asking me to move deadlines/exams because you have a project or exam in another class.
- ... asking me to accept a late submission without penalty, including if you "forgot", "thought you had already submitted it", or had internet issues on the due date.
- ... asking me for extra credit or to curve exams.
- ... asking me when the final is. [It has been scheduled already](https://www.colorado.edu/registrar/students/calendar/finals), and it takes place in the classroom unless you hear otherwise.
- ... asking me to round up your grade.

... or similar requests. Please do not try to circumvent course policies, the answer is no.


## Class Disruption

This is a [flipped classroom](flipped-classroom.md) that involves discussion between students and computer use. The classroom will be lively -- it is imperative that we remain focused. If you are seen to be checking social media/the news/sports scores, playing games, watching non-course-related videos, listening to music, etc. ... basically if you are using class time for things not related to class ... you will be asked to leave the classroom and your in-class score for the day will be a non-droppable zero. This includes phone use.
:::{caution}
A rough calculation: after dropping a few, your grade on the in-class portion of the class will be based on something like 20 in-class problems this semester. A zero on one will drop your overall grade by about 0.5%.

## Late Work

Homework will be due every two weeks, Friday at 11:59PM. I strongly discourage waiting until Friday night to do your homework.

Late work will be subject to a penalty of 5% 

Computer and internet issues are not a valid excuse for submitting late work. If you would like to "play chicken" with the deadline, then you must accept that might lose. My recommendation is to plan to submit early which will give you a buffer in case you run into trouble. 

Forgetting to submit work does not absolve you from these penalties. You can consider the zero on the assignment to be a penalty for not confirming that your work was submitted.

[Some of the best advice I can give you](../9_readings/success.md) is: get the easy stuff right. Submitting your work on time (and confirming it was submitted) is an example of the easy stuff. If you are going to do the hard work of completing the assignment, don't mess up the easy work of submitting it on time.


## AI Policy

This course allows for [responsible use of AI](../0_details/responsible-AI.md) on homework and projects. AI is prohibited on in-class activities (unless explicitly stated for a specific assignment) and on exams.

If we are not going to police AI use, the responsibility shifts to the student to understand what amount of AI use is too much. A good starting point: If you would be hesitant to show me your prompts, you probably went too far.

The instructional staff will monitor student submissions and commit history. This data will inform discussions with individual students or the class as a whole. For example, one commit near the deadline, with perfect code, is a strong indicator of AI misuse -- if that student proceeds to struggle on the exams, we will have a frank discussion.



## Final Grades, Extra Credit, and Curving

Students are assessed based on the work that they have submitted over the course of the semester. I cannot and do not take into consideration your intended graduation date, financial aid, sports eligibility, number of courses, work schedule, desire to attend grad school, or anything else.

You should assume that there is no extra credit in this class and should not ask for extra credit opportunities. Please recognize that I am tasked with determining whether you have met the learning objectives of the course. Far too often, extra credit is not actually "extra" and instead effectively covers for missed learning, thus leaving the student underprepared for ensuing classes.

A slight curve may be applied to exam grades or the overall grade, but this is not guaranteed. This may be tied to my perception of AI misuse, namely: if I am suspicious that a large portion of the class is misusing AI (e.g., based on commit history or incredibly perfect homework submissions), I will be more reluctant to curve the exams. Again, please do not ask about a curve.
