# Professional Emails


## Motivation

When applying to internships, jobs, etc., it is probably best to err on the side of caution and be aggressively polite. So, OK, start emails to a future employer with "Hope this email finds you well. I am very interested in working for your company, as I see it doing amazing things... blah blah blah"... all that nice stuff.

However, I value efficient emails. I don't want to hunt through three paragraphs to find a question. The truth (that I think we all have realized): it is mentally draining to read long emails and craft responses to them. So let's get on the same page, and be efficient!


## A good email

### Key #1: A good subject line

Firstly, you should establish the subject. I am asking that students in this course begin their emails with [MCEN 3030] -- yes, with square brackets, yes, with a space between "MCEN" and "3030". I will filter all emails that include "[MCEN 3030]" in the subject line to a folder in my inbox. I will pay special attention to this folder, and further, I will be able to find your message more easily in the future if it is in this folder.

In your future job, the subject might be "[EPG]" for engine performance group, "[PF merger]" if your company is buying another company called PF, etc.

Secondly, you should include specific details about the email contents, and the more specific the better (without getting ridiculous). "[MCEN 3030] question" is not a very good subject line -- is it a quick question like "can I use this command in my code" or is it "I got a last-second call to participate in the Olympics and need to know whether I should withdraw from this course or if we can work out a way to complete the final from Italy". The former I can answer in less than 30 seconds, the latter is going to take me a while. You should have a detailed subject line regardless, but to give you more of an incentive: I will be more inclined to open your email if I suspect I can answer the question quickly. Otherwise, it waits for when I am in "email mode".


"[MCEN 3030] question on bisection method inputs" is good. "[MCEN 3030] scikit-learn or pytorch" is good, but I can tell it is going to require a bit more thought (and I appreciate that you made that clear with your subject line). "[MCEN 3030] exam 1 accommodation room" is good. You get the picture.


### Key #2: Focused email content

I don't know who decided that all emails have to begin with "I hope this email finds you well", but I hate it. In this class, we don't need that. Here is a GREAT email:

> Subject: [MCEN 3030] use built-in flip(x)?
> 
> Hey Professor,
> 
> Can we use MATLAB's flip(x) in our code?
> 
> Thanks,
>
> Student

Here might be my response:

> yep

... hopefully you appreciate that I was able to respond quicker than I might have had I written a fluffier email. If you want to be equally brief, go ahead. Other professors might get annoyed by the brevity, not me. Just do a good subject line and I will interpret that as you being polite!

However, don't be so brief that you leave out key details. I am not going to do much debugging for you this semester, but in past semesters I have gotten emails like 

> I tried to use an if, but it keeps giving me an error.

No details about the error message, just "an error". So, now I have to send an email asking what the specific error message was, which requires the student to reply, then I have to reply to that. A whole ordeal! Include relevant information! But, also, don't just dump information on me and make me sort through it. Focused email content!
:::{aside}
Emails like this are part of the reason I am reluctant to debug for students anymore. I was "bailing out" too many students who weren't even reading and processing the error messages. Deciphering error messages -- develop this skill!

### Key #3: Don't ask for special treatment

I receive about two dozen emails every semester that boil down to students asking for special treatment that violates course policy. Leniency because they:
- are taking 19 credit hours.
- had to work.
- had a project due in another class.
- forgot to turn in an assignment, or thought they had already submitted it.
- got an error.
- fell asleep.
- had internet problems at 11:48PM.
:::{tip}
If you are going to "play chicken" with a deadline, you have to accept that you might lose.
:::
Further, in the Fall 2025 semester I received more "grade-grubbing" emails than ever, wherein students ask, e.g., for a final grade of 89.3% to be rounded to an A-.

The answer to all of these requests is no. We, unfortunately, give grades in this school, and the course policies are the rules of the game that everyone abides by. I am not going to be the judge of who has a good excuse, and it is not a course policy if I waive it for anyone who asks. Build some more robustness in your schedule where you can -- finishing things by the deadline should not, in general, be stressful.
:::{aside}
I am always wary of giving special treatment to the outspoken student, while the introverted student accepts the course policies (a deduction for being late). Why does the outspoken student deserve the higher grade? They don't.

As it pertains to the present discussion: Asking me to go against course policy immediately makes it a bad email (and it becomes a huge cognitive load for me because I have to find a gentle way to say no). Let's just stay on top of things as much as we can!
