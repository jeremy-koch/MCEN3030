# Keys to Success (not just in 3030)

<!-- **Author:** Jeremy Koch -->


1. I speculate that your career success will be correlated with your ability to focus and persevere when stuck.

Being an engineer means being able to carry out a careful analysis that may take hours or days or weeks to assemble. When we get stuck, we find our way out by learning a new topic, finding connections, reconsidering the assumptions, trying a new approach, etc. Having the wisdom, patience, and organization skills to put that all together is why we are trusted with exciting and meaningful projects (and why we make decent money). 

2. Passivity is easier, but it gets you nowhere.

You are not an empty vessel that is getting filled when I lecture, and reading solutions/watching others solve problems is not an effective way to learn. The best way to learn is to do! We assign homework so that you have problems in which you have to interpret, plan, make decisions, carry out an analysis, interpret the results, and more. These are what I really care about, but they are harder to assess than "did you use the right equation here and do the algebra right", so I am stuck assessing that.

Deciding whether to use approach 1 or approach 2 is uncomfortable, what if you are wrong? Well... be wrong for a second, then figure it out. Don't just ask which is the right way -- so passive, someone else makes the decision for you! Figuring it out yourself will teach you why it is the way it is, and you will be more ready the next time you see a related problem. 

3. AI is a tool that amplifies your skills.

I worry that there is a misconception about how AI is going to be useful in your careers. Homework problems are well-posed because they have to be -- here is the velocity and some properties, compute the pressure. This type of problem is easy for LLMs to solve, and you will probably never see it again after your fluid mechanics class.
:::{aside}
Not to say it is pointless. By doing the problem, you will develop intuition about how pressure and velocity are related, and maybe will think about the design opportunities.

Real problems are not so nice. "The pressure in my turbocharger is 15% too high" is going to get a handful of generic comments from AI that probably won't help. Turns out the seal was erroneously manifactured 5% too thick delaying the wastegate from opening, or something... I doubt that a large-language model would figure that out. (Maybe it would, in which case I would be worried for other reasons!)
:::{aside}
A pretty accurate assessment of LLMs: "This is what a good answer SOUNDS like, but as a large-language model, I don't know if it is ACTUALLY a good answer!"
:::

Now, flip it around. A wise engineer might know how to get access to a bunch of data about the turbocharger's performance. Pressure, temperature, oxygen level, time from start-up, etc., maybe an overwhelming amount of data across 10 different turbochargers! But the wise engineer knows enough about the details to coach an AI into developing a machine learning model, and then is insightful enough to triangulate a solution from that data. 

THAT is the power of LLMs. If you know what you are doing and know how to assess the validity of ideas, they can streamline some of the busywork, quickly delivering information to help you make a decision. If you don't have the foundation, you won't know the questions to ask and won't be able to discern a good idea from a bad one. Even if AI delivers a reasonable answer, could you support it? There's probably a lot of money involved, how confident are you?



4. Get the easy stuff right.

Attending class and office hours. Submitting your work on time. [Communicating in a professional way](../0_details/pro-emails.md). Staying off social media in class. Not watching soccer in class (yes, this happens). Showing up to exams with a pencil (yes, this too). These things are not hard. Get the easy stuff right and the hard stuff won't be as hard and/or you will actually reap the full rewards from your hard work.


5. I do a lot about your success, but have to stop myself from caring more than you do.

Many facets here. 


I am reading about the increasing unemployment about recent college graduates

I am not trying to put pressure on you -- I know you are getting enough of that, probably mostly from yourself! But, at the same time, I have a hard time 

This has at least two facets: (1) I 

I have had dozens of students whose exam grades are 90+%, but who consistently skip homework or turn it in late, and they end up scraping by with a C. It drives me crazy, but maybe that 


And (2) the college degree -- specifically the piece of paper that says your name and "batchelor of science" -- used to be a sign that the recipient was qualified to be a mechanical engineer, and a company would recognize . With so much AI use in college these days, that is becoming decreasingly true. The college environment itself is still valuable -- our department has many excellent teachers, . I care that your degree is meaningful, do you?
