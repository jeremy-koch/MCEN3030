# Representation of Numbers



## Binary


"Computers are just a bunch of 1's and 0's" is absolutely true -- early storage of information was achieved by

All of this is going on "under the hood" -- we don't need to spend too much time worrying about reading/writing/translating things in binary. The computer just reports numbers to us in base 10.

## Bigger Numbers



## Motivation

A number like $\pi = 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510582097494459230 ...$ has infinitely many digits. 
:::{aside}
In practice, it only takes about 40 digits to compute the radius of the universe to within a hydrogen atom. There are 90 digits here, 50 are just showboating!
