:::{exercise} A Riemann Zeta Function Question 
The summation
\begin{equation}
    \sum\limits_{s=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^s} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}.
\end{equation}
However, if you perform the summation from 1 to, say, 500, you will see a slight discrepancy from this value.

(a) Is it just that 500 is not a large enough number to "fill out" the double? Note that $\pi^2/6 \approx 1.6,$ and also recall that a double, represented in base-10, will have 15 digits. What value of $s$ is the last that will affect the double representation of the sum?

(b) Instead, we might evaluate the sum from 500 back to 1. It is more accurate... why?
