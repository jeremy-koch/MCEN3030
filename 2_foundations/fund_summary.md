# Summary and some things to think about

<!-- **Author:** Jeremy Koch<sup>1,2</sup> \ -->


## How would you...

1. Create a vector with 50 elements, equally spaced between 0 and 4?
2. Create a vector of random numbers between 2 and 3?
3. Plot $f(x)=x(3-x)$ with a continuous line?
4. Add random noise from a normal distribution to a line $f(x)=mx+b$? (With a known mean and variance.)
5. 

## Some things to think about...
- If we wanted to find the solution to $\exp(x)=1.85$ (and you didn't know where the $\ln$ button was on your calculator), is the $f(x)$ in our root-finding methods $\exp{x}$?
- Sketch $f(x)=\cos{x}-0.85$. If we try to find the first positive root of this equation using Newton-Raphson, would a seed $x_0=0$ get us there?
