# The Bisection Method

The Bisection Method is the canonical example of a bracketing method. Assuming that a function $f(x)$ is continuous and that precisely one root exists in a search range $x_L\rightarrow x_U$, it iteratively halves the size of the search range.

Throughout this class, we will often sketch out functions to try to explain/understand algorithms. However, it is usually the case that we don't actually know what the function looks like
