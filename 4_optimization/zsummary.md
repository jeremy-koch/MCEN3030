## Some things to think about...
- How would we modify the method of steepest ascent to find the minimum of a function?




- Suppose we have collected data on speed, but the equation we'd like to fit to is for kinetic energy: $K=m V^2/2$. So something like . We'll assume that mass is known. How would we write a script that imports the data and prepares it to be fit to $K(t)$?
