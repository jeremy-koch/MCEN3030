# Programming Basics -- Introduction

One common grumble about this course is that it requires you to learn math and a new programming language at the same time. Or at least it did... part of the reason we started MCEN 1030 was to deliver more experience in MATLAB/Python and many of you may have gotten to take that course instead of CSCI 1300. But anyway: I think viewing them as two separate challenges is pessimistic -- the best way to learn to program is to actually do something. This semester we are going to take a finite list of commands and do a bunch of useful things with them.

You all know what ```if```, ```for```, and ```while``` do. You know what an array/vector is. You know that you can access the various elements of an array based on their indices. What you may not be certain about is: how exactly does that look in MATLAB/Python/Julia? Should you begin a function with ```function``` or is it something else? Do you have to ```end``` an ```if``` statement? 

In previous semesters I spent time in class going through these things in class, with students copying what I wrote and then confirming they get the same output. In retrospect, I am suspicious it was a waste of time... so passive for students! It is not going to stick!

So this semester we will do something more productive. I have made available a [nearly complete list of commands]() that will be used in homework, and have a page on [functions and scripts](). I don't even think you should read those, yet, let's just dive into some [tasks](), and use those pages as references.
