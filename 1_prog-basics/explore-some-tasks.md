## Taylor Series Convergence?

We will soon use the Taylor Series
\begin{equation}
\hat{f}(x) = f(x_0) + \sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n!}(x-x_0)^nf^{(n)}(x_0)
\end{equation}
as part of a derivation. But: are we so sure the Taylor Series converges, even when $(x-x_0)\gg 1$? 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item First, write a little function that computes the factorial of a number. Hint: Check the example code included in the [languages]() page, and instead of adding, multiply.
    \item Make a plot of $n$ vs. $c^n/n!$, with $c$ being a decent-sized constant (say 100). Confirm that the plot asymptotes to zero. It may be worthwhile to do a log-scaled plot.
\end{enumerate}

## Infinite Series
The summation
\begin{equation}
    \sum\limits_{k=1}^\infty 
\end{equation}
