# Checking your code
<!-- 
**Author:** Jeremy Koch -->



A quick comment on how you might check your code.

<!-- I will likely be pretty explicit about the tasks your homework needs to achieve. For example, in the bisection method  -->

## Root-finding methods

What are the roots of $f(x)=5-x$? What about $f(x) = exp(x)-2.718$? What are some other ones you know, and can use to check?

## 


## Differential equations

- What is the solution to $\dot{x} = -x$? What does that function look like?
