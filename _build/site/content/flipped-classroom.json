If we embrace it, the classroom is going to be full of collaboration and discussion. \n\n### Pitfalls\n\nIf you choose, you may look around on the internet to find extreme opinions on the flipped classroom. I'll go ahead and list the common criticisms here for other classes (I am going to try to avoid all of these):\n- It just ends up being more homework. (We will start homework in class.)\n- \n\n\n\n\n\nStudents who just plug in to AI are going to get nothing from this format, and peer-advice like \"just plug it into AI\" is not allowed (except, maybe, for debugging, but even that is discouraged). \n\nAttendance is basically required. Show up to class, get the easy stuff right.\n\nYou will have to watch videos before each class, and so by definition you have homework for this class at least two nights a week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ","key":"wTtHcGo4cr"}],"key":"KgST5Ds6lJ"}],"key":"IpqUPXcuaY"},"references":{"cite":{"order":[],"data":{}}}}
