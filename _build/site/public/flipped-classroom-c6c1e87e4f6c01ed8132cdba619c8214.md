# The Flipped Classroom

**Author:** Jeremy Koch<sup>1,2</sup> \

## Motivation

I am excited about this semester because we are going to use the "flipped classroom" format for this course. 

## Organization

Here's how it will look:
- Every week I will release the "lecture content" as a collection of videos. I have gone through great efforts to streamline these videos and make them "bite sized" such that they rarely will exceed 20 minutes, and often will be less than 10.

I could have made the pun "byte sized" but respect you all too much to sink to that level.
::: 
- The same content, delivered in a traditional format, might have taken a whole class period to cover because students would ask questions along the way. That is an issue with this format -- the inability to ask clarifying questions -- but we will spend the first part of each class period addressing these questions.
- Then you will be given a problem to be completed collaboratively (and submitted in groups). An example would be to carry out an algorithm by hand through two iterations. The purpose of this is to help you understand the numerical logic, and to give you something you can check your code against (e.g. by adding an ```if iteration==2, print result``` line to an intermediate version of your code).
- The remainder of class will be devoted to working on your code in groups -- effectively, this is office hour time. You may collaborate with colleagues, but everyone writes their own code. You may ask me or the TAs questions. The idea here is to trade the 30 minutes of "lecture" time at home for 30 minutes of homework time in "lecture", and to have that time be immensely productive because you are collaborating on the problems.
- The net effect, I hope, is that you will have a deeper understanding of the content (because you talk about it from many angles with your colleagues) while actually requiring less time overall (when considering class+homework time).



## Benefits

If we embrace it, the classroom is going to be full of collaboration and discussion.
