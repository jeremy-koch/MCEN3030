# Keys to Success (not just in 3030)

1. I speculate that your career success will be correlated with your ability to focus for long periods of time.

I am guilty of this too -- I'll scroll on instagram for an hour, and probably see 200+ short videos in that time. 


2. Passivity is getting you nowhere.

Part of the reason I implemented a "flipped" classroom" in 3030 is that I have watched students become increasingly passive in their education. You are not an empty vessel that is getting filled when I talk, you need to be active. Actually think about the material and make the connections. The point of homework is to help you do that! Don't think of homework as a task that needs to be completed as quickly as possible, it should take however long it takes for you to understand the content.

One thing I do in office hours, which may not be perceived well but I genuinely believe in, is to ask that students explain things to each other. If I tell you the answer, it is perceived as the absolute, inarguable truth, and you will not think about it as hard. If your friend tells you an answer, you are a bit more suspicious, or maybe you both are a little uncertain, and that leads to more thinking and more discussion.

Also: this is a bit about AI. AI is letting students skip class and complete homework with zero effort.

3. AI is a tool that amplifies your skills.

It is very unlikely you will have a career as an engineer if you are literally looking up everything on ChatGPT. 

4. Don't mess up the easy stuff.

Submitting your work on time. Attending class and office hours. 

As an instructor, I, too, find it incredibly frustrating when I see a bright student mess up the little things. I have had dozens of students whose exam grades are 85+%, but who miss work or consistently turn it in late, and they end up scraping by with a C. 

5. I cannot care more about your success than you do.
