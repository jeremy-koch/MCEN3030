# Course Policies

**Author:** Jeremy Koch

For more details about course policy, see the official course syllabus on Canvas.

:::{attention}
This document, and the course syllabus, cannot outline explicit policies for every eventuality. I reserve the right to modify any course policy in response to significant events over the semester. This could include, but is not limited to: excessive class cancellations due to weather or pandemic, the AI bubble popping (which may eliminate free versions of the tool), widespread academic dishonesty, an inability to not be distracted by the news/social media/etc. during class, 

Keep in mind, your success is my success, and so you should have nothing to worry about here if you approach this class earnestly.

in-class problems:

These will be completed in groups of three towards the beginning of each class period and will be mostly tech-free. An example problem is: compute the first two iterations of an algorithm by hand. The goal is for you to get a feel for how the algorithm works which will allow you to better understand how to translate it to code. Further, it will give you a check to see if your code is workting: in the above case, ```if iteration==2, print x``` might be a good thing to compare against.

Bigger picture: These points represent your active participation in discussions with your colleagues, which I believe is the most productive way to learn the course material. Submission will occur before the end of the class period. There will be no option to submit these late -- if you missed the class discussion, you missed the learning opportunity and will not receive credit for it. However, we will drop a small number of these assignments, likely 3, in the final grade calculation, and so you will not be penalized if you miss a small number of classes due to illness, travel, or a need to temporarily prioritize another course. Note that you are not excused from the content if you miss class -- it merely 
:::{caution}
I do not approve of prioritizing another course, by the way, but you are adults. I also do not recommend trying to be strategic with these absences -- save them for when you have a cold and can't think straight.

homework repository:

Over the course of the semester we will learn about and write functions/scripts that implement approximately 20 computational ideas. This is your homework, though note that we will almost always have the opportunity to begin this work in the classroom (where your colleagues, a TA, or myself will be around to help you talk through your ideas).

Homework will be submitted via GitHub Classroom, mimicking the development of an actual code repository.

The instructional staff will retrieve the assignments from

machine learning project:

We will get some authentic experience in doing a machine learning calculation. We will briefly introduce the field, describing some of the strategies but not necessarily diving deeply into . Python (scikit-learn is my recommendation).

There may be intermediate milestones, including submitting a topic and your LLM prompting. More details will be posted.

AI use is encouraged, tutorial use is encouraged, but plagiarism is not. An example of plagiarism in this context is: taking someone's completed analysis published in a blog somewhere and submitting it as your own work.

Plagiarism on this project is completely unacceptable and will lead to immediate failure of the course and submission to the honor council, regardless of your grade in the other aspects of the course.

email professionalism:

The point of this is not to discourage emails! Rather, it is to make you think twice before...

- ... sending an email with just "question" (or something similar) in the subject line. See [how to write emails for this class]().
- ... asking me to move deadlines/exams because you have a project or exam in another class.
- ... asking me if there will be a curve.
- ... asking me to accept a late submission without penalty, including if you "forgot" or "thought you had already submitted it".
- ... asking me for extra credit.
- ... asking me when the final is. [It has been scheduled already](https://www.colorado.edu/registrar/students/calendar/finals), and it takes place in the classroom unless you hear otherwise.
- ... asking me to round up your grade.

... or similar requests, in an attempt to circumvent course policy. The 0.2 points is already in the gradebook. If you send any of the above, or similar, you lose it. May not seem like a lot, but FYI I do not round an 89.9% to an A-... I might round an 89.99% but no promises. There has to be a cutoff somewhere, and for a person who has sent only succinct, organized emails all semester, without attempting to circumvent course policy, that cutoff is effectively no higher than 89.8% with this bonus.

If you have an acute medical situation or travel associated with a university-sanctioned team (e.g., CU lacrosse or the Wind Energy Team), please do send the email.


## Class Disruption

This is a "flipped classroom" that involves discussion between students and computer use. The classroom will be lively. It is imperative that we all resist the urge to be distracted. If you are seen to be checking social media/the news/sports scores, playing games, watching non-course-related videos, listening to music, etc. -- basically if you are using class time for things not related to class -- you will be asked to leave the classroom and your in-class scores for the day will be a non-droppable zero. Phone use is a thing not related to class.
:::{aside}
A rough calculation: after dropping a few, your grade on the "in-class" portion of the class will be based on something like 20 in-class problems this semester. A zero on one will drop your overall grade by about 0.5%.

## Late Work

Work submitted after the deadline will be subject to a 50% penalty. However, you may submit 

Computer and internet issues are not a valid excuse for submitting late work. If you would like to "play chicken" with the deadline, then you must accept that might lose. My recommendation is to plan to submit early which means you will have a buffer. 

Forgetting to submit work does not absolve you from these penalties. "I thought I submitted it" is not going to sway me. Please do not submit timestamps "proving you did it on time" or email me your work after the submission portal is closed in hopes of receiving some credit. You can consider the zero on the assignment to be a penalty for not confirming that your work was submitted.

Some of the best advice I can give you is: get the easy stuff right. Submitting your work on time (and confirming it was submitted) is an example of "the easy stuff". If you are going to do the hard work of completing the assignment, don't mess up the easy work of submitting your work on time.


## AI Policy

This course allows responsible use of AI on homework and projects. AI is prohibited on in-class activities (unless explicitly stated to the contrary for a specific assignment) and on exams.

"[Responsible use]()" is a judgment made by the instructional staff and is described in the linked page. Students who are suspected of irresponsible use may be asked to schedule a meeting wherein they will explain their code.

The penalty for AI misuse may include a zero on the assignment, failure of the course, and/or a report to the honor council.
