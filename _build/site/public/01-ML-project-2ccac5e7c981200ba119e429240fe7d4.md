# Machine Learning Project (Preview)

**Author:** Jeremy Koch<sup>1,2</sup> \

## Introduction

Machine learning is a topic that we could spend an entire semester on it -- there is indeed a class on it offered by our department in the fall semester. We are going to get a taste of it in this course.

## AI use

If we are devoting only a fraction of a semester to the topic, we are going to need AI assistance! 


## Languages

Python is the preferred language for most data scientists. I can't confirm that it is structurally better than other languages, but there are just more resources.
