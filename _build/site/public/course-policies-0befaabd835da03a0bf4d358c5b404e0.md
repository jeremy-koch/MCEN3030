# Course Policies

**Author:** Jeremy Koch

For more details about course policy, see the official course syllabus on Canvas.

:::{attention}
This document, and the course syllabus, cannot outline explicit policies for every eventuality. I reserve the right to modify any course policy in response to significant events over the semester. This could include, but is not limited to: excessive class cancellations due to weather or pandemic, the AI bubble popping (which may eliminate free versions of the tool), widespread academic dishonesty, 

Keep in mind, your success is my success, and so you should have nothing to worry about here if you approach the class earnestly.

 5% homework repository -- commit history
 5% ML project

20% midterm 1
20% midterm 2
25% final exam

0.2% email professionalism (bonus points)

=100.2%

in-class problems:

These will be completed in groups of three towards the beginning of each class period and will be mostly tech-free. An example is to compute the first two iterations of an algorithm by hand. The goal is to get a feel for how the algorithm works, which may allow for an easier translation to code, and to give you a check to see if your code is workting: in the above case, ```if iteration==2, print x``` might be a good thing to compare against.

email professionalism:

The point of this is not to discourage emails! Rather, it is to make you think twice before...

- ... sending an email with just "question" (or something similar) in the subject line. See [how to write emails for this class]().
- ... asking me to move deadlines/exams because you have a project or exam in another class.
- ... asking me if there will be a curve.
- ... asking me to accept a late submission, including if you "forgot" or "thought you had already submitted it".
- ... asking me for extra credit.
- ... asking me when the final is. [It has been scheduled already](https://www.colorado.edu/registrar/students/calendar/finals), and it takes place in the classroom unless you hear otherwise.
- ... asking me to round up your grade.

... or similar. The 0.2 points is already in the gradebook. If you send any of the above, or similar, you lose it. May not seem like a lot, but FYI I do not round an 89.9% to an A-... I might round an 89.99% but no promises. There has to be a cutoff somewhere, and for a person who has sent only succinct, organized emails all semester, without attempting to circumvent course policy, that cutoff is effectively no higher than 89.8% with this bonus.

If you have an acute medical situation or travel associated with a university-sanctioned team (e.g., CU lacrosse or the Wind Energy Team), please do send the email.

## Late Work

Work submitted after the deadline will be subject to a 50% penalty. However, you may submit 

Computer and internet issues are not a valid excuse for submitting late work. If you would like to "play chicken" with the deadline, then you must accept that might lose. My recommendation is to plan to submit early which means you will have a buffer. 

Forgetting to submit work does not absolve you from these penalties. "I thought I submitted it" is not going to sway me. Please do not submit timestamps "proving you did it on time" or email me your work after the submission portal is closed in hopes of receiving some credit. You can consider the zero on the assignment to be a penalty for not confirming that your work was submitted.

Some of the best advice I can give you is: get the easy stuff right. Submitting your work on time (and confirming it was submitted) is an example of "the easy stuff". If you are going to do the hard work of completing the assignment, don't mess up the easy work of submitting your work on time.
