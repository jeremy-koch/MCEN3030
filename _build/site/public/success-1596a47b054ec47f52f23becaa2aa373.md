# Keys to Success (not just in 3030)

<!-- **Author:** Jeremy Koch -->


1. I speculate that your career success will be correlated with your ability to focus for long periods of time.

Being an engineer is not about "trivia", memorizing terms . It is about being able to carry out a careful analysis that may take hours or days or weeks to assemble.

I am guilty of this too -- I'll scroll on instagram for an hour, and probably see 200+ short videos in that time.

2. Passivity is getting you nowhere.

Part of the reason I implemented a "flipped" classroom" in 3030 is that I have watched students become increasingly passive in their education. You are not an empty vessel that is getting filled when I talk, you need to be active. Actually think about the material and make the connections. The point of homework is to help you do that! Don't think of homework as a task that needs to be completed as quickly as possible, it should take however long it takes for you to understand the content.

One thing I do in office hours, which may not be perceived well but I genuinely believe in, is to ask that students explain things to each other. If I tell you the answer, it is perceived as the absolute, inarguable truth, and you will not think about it as hard. If your friend tells you an answer, you are a bit more suspicious, or maybe you both are a little uncertain, and that leads to more thinking and more discussion.

Also: this is a bit about AI. AI is letting students skip class and complete homework with zero effort.

3. AI is a tool that amplifies your skills.



If you do not have a skill, it cannot be amplified. 

AI is letting students 

It is very unlikely you will have a successful career as an engineer if you are looking up almost everything on ChatGPT. 

4. Get the easy stuff right.

Attending class and office hours. Submitting your work on time. [Communicating in a professional way](). Staying off TikTok in class. These things are not hard. Get the easy stuff right and the hard stuff won't be as hard and/or you will reap the full rewards from your hard work. 




5. I cannot care more about your success than you do. This has at least two facets: (1) I 

I have had dozens of students whose exam grades are 90+%, but who consistently skip homework or turn it in late, and they end up scraping by with a C. It drives me crazy, but maybe that 


And (2) the college degree -- specifically the piece of paper that says your name and "batchelor of science" -- used to be a sign that the recipient was 



is decreasing. The experience, the wisdom you gain, etc., is still valuable, but it is harder to demonstrate that you actually have it -- the piece of paper 


I am worried about this generation.
