# Newton-Raphson Method (1D)

**Author:** Jeremy Koch<sup>1,2</sup> \

## Motivation

The Newton-Raphson Method is another root-finding algorithm, though this one is called an "open" method because the search is not confined to a specific range. This has it's positives -- most notably, it converges more quickly than the bisection method -- and negatives -- it is not guaranteed to find a solution, even if one exists, and also might find the "wrong" solution.

## Idea

The idea is this: we have a function for which we are seeking the location where $f(x)=0$, and we have a guess for the solution $x_0$, called the seed. We linearize the function around $x_0$ and trace the resulting line back to $y=0$. If our guess is decent and the function is not too erratic, it is likely that the associated $x$-location (call it $x_1$) is a better estimate of the root than our initial guess. We repeat the process, now linearizing around $x=x_1$ and tracing the line back to find an even better estimate, $x_2$, and then maybe we use that too get an even better estimate, etc.~etc.~etc., until we have acceptably converged. 

## Derivative

With our linearized function $f(x) \approx f(x_0)+ f'(x_0)(x-x_0)$, we can set $f(x) =0$ and rearrange to solve for $x$, the better guess for the root. Generalizing the algorithm:

$$ x_{i+1} = x{i} - \frac{f(x_i)}{f'(x_i)}


are following the algorithm:

A function may be linearized by

$$ f(x) \approx f(x_0)
