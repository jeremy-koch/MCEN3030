## Introduction

Machine learning is a topic that we could spend an entire semester on it -- there is indeed a class on it offered by our department in the fall semester. We are going to get a taste of it in this course.

## AI use

If we are devoting only a fraction of a semester to the topic, we are going to need AI assistance!

Python has 

To be honest, I have never gotten Tensor Flow to work!
