# "Professional" Emails

**Author:** Jeremy Koch

## Motivation

Other instructors in the department are trying to prepare you for the job market, and they have probably taught you how to write "professional emails". When applying to internships, jobs, etc., it is probably best to err on the side of caution and be aggressively polite. So, OK, start emails to a future employer with "Hope this email finds you well. I am very interested in working for your company, as I see it doing amazing things... blah blah blah"... all that nice stuff.

However, in this class, I value efficient emails. I don't want to hunt through three paragraphs to find a question, I want one-sentence!  The basic truth I think we all have realized: it is mentally draining to read long emails and craft responses to them. We would all feel better if we were not writing a paragraph of small talk in every single email we send. Let's be efficient! 

So, maybe I am teaching you how to write emails once you have the job... and are communicating with the same 8 people all the time. This class is like that.

## A good email

### Key #1: A good subject line

Firstly, you should establish the subject. I am asking that students in this course begin their emails with [MCEN 3030] -- yes, with square brackets, yes, with a space between "MCEN" and "3030". I will filter all emails that include "MCEN 3030" in the subject line to a folder in my inbox. I will pay special attention to this folder, and further, I will be able to find your message more easily in the future if it is in this folder.

Secondly, you should include specific details about the email contents, and the more specific the better (without getting ridiculous). "[MCEN 3030] question" is not a very good subject line -- is it a quick question like "can I use this command in my code?" or is it "I got a last-second call to participate in the olympics and need to know whether I should withdraw from this course or if we can work out a way to complete the final from Italy". The former I can answer in less than 30 seconds, the latter is going to take me a while. You should have a detailed subject line regardless, but to give you more of an incentive: I will be more inclined to open your email if I suspect I can answer the question quickly, and if I suspect the email will require more effort, I will likely leave it unread until I am in "email mode".


So, if you want me to answer your email ASAP, include a good subject line. "[MCEN 3030] question on bisection inputs" is pretty good. "[MCEN 3030] scikit-learn or pytorch" is good, but I can tell it is going to require a bit more thought (and I appreciate that you made that clear with your subject line). "[MCEN 3030] exam 1 accommodation room" is good. You get the picture.


### Key #2: Focused email content

I don't know who decided that all emails have to begin with "I hope this email finds you well", but I hate it.
:::{aside}
Maybe I am a curmudgeon, but if you want the email to actually "find me well", don't start it with "I hope this email finds you well"! It found me annoyed!
:::
When you are trying to get an interview somewhere, fine, err on the side of caution and be aggressively polite. But in this class, we don't need that -- the longer the email, the more effort it takes to process, and the slower the response. For MCEN 3030, at least: don't fill your email with fluff.

Here is a GREAT email:

> Subject: [MCEN 3030] use built-in flip(x)?
> 
> Hey Professor,
> 
> Can we use MATLAB's flip(x) in our code?
> 
> Thanks,
> student

Here might be my response:

> yep

... which I was able to type quickly, perhaps while walking to the parking garage. If you want to be equally brief, go ahead. Other professors might get annoyed by the brevity, not me. Just do a good subject line and I will interpret that as you being polite!

However, don't be so brief that you leave out key details. I am not going to do much debugging for you this semester, but in semesters past I have gotten emails like 

> I tried to use if/elif, but it keeps giving me an error.

No details about the error message, the email just said "an error". So, now I have to send an email asking what the specific error message was, which requires the student to reply, then I have to reply to that. A whole ordeal! Include relevant information!
:::{aside}
Emails like this are part of the reason I am not debugging for students anymore. I felt I was "bailing out" too many students who weren't even reading and processing the error messages, which usually explicitly mention the line number and type of error.
:::

But, also, don't just dump information on me and make me sort through it. Focused email content!

### Key #3: Don't ask for special treatment

I receive countless emails every semester that boil down to students asking for special treatment, including asking for accommodations because they:
- are taking 19 credit hours.
- had to work.
- had a project due in another class.
- "forgot" to turn in an assignment, or "thought they had already submitted it".
- "got an error".
- fell asleep.
- had internet problems at 11:48PM.
:::{aside}
If you are going to play chicken with the deadline, you have to accept that you might lose.
:::
I cannot assign unique course policies to every student based on their personal circumstances -- the course policies exist for a reason, they are the rules of the game that we all abide by. 


I am always wary of giving special treatment to the outspoken student, while the introverted student accepts the course policies and stays up until 4AM finishing the homework. Why does the outspoken student deserve the higher grade? They don't.

This behavior is a type of "unprofessionalism" that I do care about. You should start your work early in the week,
:::{aside}
A joke among professors: It is the "due" date, not the "do" date. Not all of our jokes are lame, just most of them.
:::
submit HOURS before the deadline, CONFIRM that you have submitted your work. If you are taking 19 hours or are working part-time, I think that is really admirable, but this means you have to be more responsible.


<!-- To be clear: I would like to learn more about you, to hear about where you are from and whether you are working part-time and where you are applying for internships.  -->
