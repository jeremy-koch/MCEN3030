# Intro

**Author:** Jeremy Koch

Welcome to MCEN 3030: Computational Methods



## Some policy highlights

- We will use the "flipped classroom" model. Watch a couple short videos before class, read the associated sections in the little "book" I am putting together (this website). Then during class time, you will work through a problem in groups by hand, and then get started on putting the algorithms into computer code. Ask your neighbors for help, ask me, ask the TA. My goal is to trade 20-30 minutes of lectures videos at home for 20-30 minutes of homework time during "lecture", with that time being a really valuable jump-start to your homework.

- Moreover, I want to cultivate a classroom environment that is highly collaborative

- You have a green light to use AI in many course aspects.
:::{aside}
AI = artificial intelligence

LLM = large language model
:::
This is going to allow for many possibilities in this course that I am really excited about, and, I think, could be an authentic experience for you -- doesn't seem like these tools are going anywhere, so we'll use them. However, a strong warning: the exams in this course make up most of the grade, and they are pencil and paper.

- You can choose what language you use (perhaps with some limits). If you really enjoy C++, you can use it. If you want to go with a language you will (probably) see in MCEN 3047: Data Analysis and MCEN 4043: System Dynamics, think about MATLAB. If you are a bit adventurous, try this new language called Julia. AI will help you get your feet underneath you!


## Some content highlights

- We will spend the first week setting up GitHub. GitHub "repositories" are a very standard way to share code, and this will force us to think carefully about how to manage and organize files -- maybe one of the most important lessons of the semester.

- We will do a machine learning project

- We will solve coupled nonlinear differential equations, including those that describe [mathematical chaos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system)







## How to use this site

- Course units are in the panel on the left, and clicking them will open a drop-down menu. Each item in that drop-down menu is a short reading on the topic, to augment the course videos.


- Because this is a "polyglot" course,
:::{aside}
"polyglot" = many languages
:::
most of the times that code is referenced, it will be included in an environment like the following. Choose your language, then see the code in that language. In the top-right corner of each coding environment, you can choose an icon to copy that code block. While we can't run the code on the webpage, you can paste it into your working environment and run it. Please understand that it is a big undertaking to include this feature, and there may be some small mistakes in the code! Confirm it does what you think it does!

- At the end of each unit (the topics on the left) is a "Summary" page. These will include questions like "how would you do this?" This is your study guide for the exams! Exam questions will be about using the functions we write this semester, and part of that is writing the code that glues everything together. So you will need to create the inputs, understand and call the functions, and handle the outputs, and maybe there will be some problems where you need to interweave two functions!
:::{warning}
Overuse of AI might keep you from understanding the inputs/outputs of the functions, and you might struggle with the auxiliary tasks (e.g. creating an input array of evenly spaced numbers, preallocating space for the output array) too. You need to figure out how to use AI responsibly. [I give recommendations here](./readings/0-responsible-AI.md).
