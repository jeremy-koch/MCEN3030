# Intro

**Author:** Jeremy Koch

Welcome to MCEN 3030: Computational Methods



## Some policy highlights

- Class periods will be for discussion and collaboration. Watch a couple short videos before class, read the associated sections in the little "book" I am putting together (this website). Then during class time, you will work through a problem in groups by hand, and then get started on putting the algorithms into computer code. Ask your neighbors for help, ask me, ask the TA. My goal is to trade 20-30 minutes of lectures videos at home for 20-30 minutes of homework time during "lecture", with that time being a really valuable jump-start to your homework.

- Moreover, I want to cultivate a classroom environment that is highly collaborative

- You have a green light to use AI in many course aspects.
:::{aside}
AI = artificial intelligence

LLM = large language model
:::
This is going to allow for many possibilities in this course that I am really excited about, and, I think, could be an authentic experience for you -- doesn't seem like these tools are going anywhere, so we'll use them. However, a strong warning: the exams in this course make up most of the grade, and they are pencil and paper. Overuse of AI

- You can choose what language you use (perhaps with some limits). If you really enjoy C++, you can use it. If you want to go with a language you will (probably) see in Data Analysis and System Dynamics, think about MATLAB. If you are a bit adventurous, try this new language called Julia. AI will help you get your feet underneath you!


## Some content highlights

- We will spend the first week setting up GitHub. GitHub "repositories" are a very standard way to share code, and this will force us to think carefully about how to manage and organize files -- maybe one of the most important lessons of the semester.

- We will do a machine learning project







## How to use this site

Course units are in the panel on the left, and clicking


Because this is a "polyglot" course,
:::{aside}
"polyglot" = many languages
:::
most of the times that code is referenced, it will be included in an environment like this, where you can choose your language:
::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} MATLAB

Example code:
```matlab
k=2;
N=50;
S=0;        % initialize the sum at zero
for n=1:N
    S=S+1/n^k;
end
print(S)
```
:::


:::{tab-item} python

:::


:::{tab-item} Julia

:::


:::{tab-item} C++

:::


:::{tab-item} Other languages
Contact me. Don't do assembly, machine learning, or FORTRAN (shudders).

Further, within each tab is a coding environment, and in the top-right corner of the coding environment, you can choose an icon to copy that code block. While we can't run the code on the webpage, you can paste it into your working environment and run it. Please understand that it is a big undertaking to include this feature, and there may be some small mistakes in the code! 




At the end of each unit (the topics on the left) is a "Summary" page. These will include questions like "how would you do this?" This is your study guide for the exams! Exam questions will be about using the functions we write this semester and you will be asked to do
