## Late Work

Computer and internet issues are not a valid excuse for submitting late work. If you would like to "play chicken" with the deadline, then you must accept that might lose. My recommendation is to plan to submit by 9PM and then you have a three-hour window to get it done and check that it was submitted properly.

Forgetting to submit work does not absolve you from these penalties. "I thought I submitted it" is not going to sway me. Please do not submit timestamps "proving you did it on time" or email me your work after the submission portal is closed in hopes of receiving some credit. You can consider the zero on the assignment a penalty for not confirming that your work was submitted.

Some of the best advice I can give you is: get the easy stuff right. Submitting your work on time (and confirming it was submitted) is an example of "the easy stuff". If you are going to do the hard work of completing the assignment, don't mess up the easy work of submitting your work on time.
