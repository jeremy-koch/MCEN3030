# The Flipped Classroom

**Author:** Jeremy Koch

## Motivation

I am excited about this semester because we are going to use the "flipped classroom" format for this course. My main motivation is to make this class active and collaborative. I have observed a sharp increase in student passivity in the past two years -- less participation in class, less adventurousness. Perhaps this cohort was already going to buck that trend, but I am putting a framework in place that is going to make sure of it.

Applying the algorithms in this class takes some courage! You will write 9 "broken" versions of a function before the tenth works perfectly. The first 9 were not wrong, they represent the work it takes . As much as possible, I am going to make you do that work: you will not learn as much if I tell you "oh you need to change the upper bound to N-1" or "you need to put parentheses around that"


## Organization

Here's how it will look:
- Every week I will release the "lecture content" as a collection of videos. I have gone through great efforts to streamline these videos and make them "bite-sized"/"byte-sized" such that they rarely will exceed 20 minutes, and often will be less than 10. Probably two to watch before Tuesday's class and two to watch before Thursday's, maybe an hour a week.
- The same content, delivered in a traditional format, might have taken a whole class period to cover (that is, 2.5 hours per week). This is both a benefit and a drawback: much of each 75-minute class period is devoted to getting the class to quiet down, fighting HDMI cables, making and correcting little mistakes, saying umm... a lot of wasted time that we will mostly avoid. However, a lot of that time is spent on questions from you, which is definitely not a waste of time, and obviously you cannot ask those questions. So, an admitted drawback, but also it could be an opportunity to think on your own (be less passive).
:::{aside}
We will have a Slack channel where you can immediately ask clarifying questions, and hopefully will hear a response from colleagues watching the videos at the same time. You will probably be on a on a similar schedule with many of the 160 students who are taking this class!
:::
- We will spend the first few minutes of each class with a very brief summary and questions (in case a good night's rest didn't cause the answers to materialize). The summary will not be a complete rehashing of the videos, and instead will be a reminder of the important equations such that we are all on the same page for the class that day.
- You will be given a problem to be completed collaboratively (and submitted in groups). An example would be to carry out an algorithm by hand through two iterations. The purpose of this is to help you understand the logic of the algorithm by going through it yourself -- more-or-less, you will just need to translate that process into language a computer can understand. Further, these may give you something you can check your code against.
:::{aside}
An example of a check: you could add an ```if iteration==2, print result``` line to an intermediate version of your code. Get rid of it when publishing your final version, but no reason you can't have some extra stuff in there until then.
:::
- The remainder of class will be devoted to working on your code in groups -- effectively, this is office hour time. You may collaborate with colleagues, but everyone writes their own code. You may ask me or the TAs questions.

So the trade I am offering you (and I guess you are being forced to accept) is 30 minutes of "lecture" time at home for 30 minutes of homework time in "lecture", twice a week. It is a good trade though: that time in class will be immensely productive because you are collaborating on the problems. I hypothesize that you will need to devote fewer hours to this course than you would if it was a traditional 


## Benefits

The net effect, I hope, is that you will have a deeper understanding of the content (because you talk about it from many angles with your colleagues) while actually requiring less time overall (when considering class+homework time).

Also: our department is well-respected for its design courses (GEEN 1400 Freshman Projects, MCEN 3025 Component Design, and the year-long senior design). A large part of this is that you work on a team. This classroom approach is going to give you experience in discussing 


If we embrace it, the classroom is going to be full of collaboration and discussion. 



## Pitfalls

If you choose, you may look around on the internet to find extreme opinions on the flipped classroom. I'll go ahead and list the common criticisms here for other classes (I am going to try to avoid all of these):
- The teacher . ()





Students who just plug in to AI are going to get nothing from this format, and peer-advice like "just plug it into AI" is not allowed (except, maybe, for debugging, but even that is discouraged). 

Attendance is basically required. Show up to class, get the easy stuff right.

You will have to watch videos before each class, and so by definition you have homework for this class at least two nights a week.





You need to realize as soon as possible that AI cannot make you wiser, and that graduating from this department with a degree in 






## Motivation



The main reason for this approach is the following: over the past few years, I have noticed a trend of students becoming increasingly passive in THEIR education. Specifically, I have perceived an attitude 



Coding and implementing algorithms is not a linear process. In fact, you will likely produce 9 "broken" functions before 

When I explain my code 



Implementing the algorithms in this class takes a certain degree of courage: to try things and fail, a willingness to seek out resources and tutorials (not AI) and modify them to your needs, . In short, a lot of things that are not passive at all. 





In past semesters I would often teach the theory of the class . In retrospect, I think I was enabling the passivity! So this semester I am planning to avoid that from the beginning. 


I strongly believe that the only way to learn something is to actually do it --



As part of this, there are certain aspects of this course that will require some exploration.
