## AI Misuse

Your instructors are not naïve. For engineering courses, the most audacious behavior I have seen is students taking screenshots of problems, pasting into ChatGPT, and then copying the results. These students possibly did not even read the problem!

I have given the following (perhaps controversial) advice in the past, and I guess will give it here: If you care that little about mechanical engineering courses, you should consider switching majors. Find something you are actually passionate about. You are in the first stages of your careers and might spend the next 40 years as a mechanical engineer... it sounds like a (curse)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkey%27s_Paw] to be given what you want, today (very little effort on your homework) just for you to be miserable for the next four decades.
