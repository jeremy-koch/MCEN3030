# Course Policies

<!-- **Author:** Jeremy Koch -->

For more details about course policy, see the official course syllabus on Canvas.

:::{attention}
This document, and the course syllabus, cannot outline explicit policies for every eventuality. I reserve the right to modify any course policy in response to significant events over the semester. This could include, but is not limited to: excessive class cancellations due to weather or pandemic, changes in the accessibility of AI tools (e.g. if free versions disappear), widespread academic dishonesty, students not making effective use of class time, etc.

Keep in mind, your success is my success, and so you should have nothing to worry about if you approach this class earnestly.

**in-class problems:**

These will be completed in groups of three towards the beginning of each class period and will be mostly tech-free. An example problem is: compute the first two iterations of an algorithm by hand. The goal is for you to get a feel for how the algorithm works, which will allow you to better understand how to translate it to code. Further, it will give you a check to see if your code is working: in the above case, an ```if iteration==2, print x``` within your loop might be a good thing to check out.

Bigger picture: These points represent your active participation in discussions with your colleagues, which I believe is the most productive way to learn the course material. Submission will occur before the end of the class period. There will be no option to submit these late -- if you missed the class discussion, you missed the learning opportunity and will not receive credit for it. However, we will drop a small number of these assignments, likely 4, in the final grade calculation, and so you will not be penalized if you miss a small number of classes due to illness, travel, or a need to temporarily prioritize another course. Note that you are not excused from the content if you miss class -- it won't affect your grade to miss a few classes, but you are still expected to get information from a classmate.
:::{caution}
I do not approve of prioritizing another course, by the way, but you are adults and can make that call. I also do not recommend trying to be strategic with these absences -- save them for when you are sick. If you miss our class early in the semester to study for another class, then are sick late in the semester, that stinks. If you are sick for more than two weeks of the semester, please contact the Dean of Students.

**homework repository:**

Over the course of the semester we will learn 25-30 computational ideas. Implementing these ideas as functions/scripts will be your homework, to be submitted via GitHub Classroom (mimicking the development of an actual code repository).

We will usually have the opportunity to begin this work in the classroom where your colleagues, a TA, or myself will be around to help you talk through your ideas. However...
:::{warning}
The instructional staff will monitor GitHub commits that occur Tu/Th at ~12:15 and ~1:45PM, i.e., at the end of class periods. If we see that the two sections are not making use of the in-class time, as evidenced by a low percentage of students committing something by the end of class, we will eliminate this working opportunity and replace it with additional in-class problems or lecture content. 
:::

<!-- We will additionally monitor the commit history over the course of the semester. A student who consistently submits one (perfect) version of the code shortly before the deadline is almost certainly misusing AI -->

**machine learning project:**

We will get some authentic experience in doing a machine learning calculation. We will briefly introduce the field, describing some of the strategies but not necessarily diving deeply into the math. MATLAB has a machine learning toolbox, Python has several packages and has the most robust machine learning community (Scikit-learn is my recommendation, but PyTorch and TensorFlow are out there too), Julia has Lux and Flux.
:::{aside}
I cannot get TensorFlow to work on my machine, it crashes.
:::

There may be intermediate milestones such as submitting a topic for approval and including your LLM prompting. More details will be posted.

AI use is encouraged, tutorial use is encouraged, but plagiarism is not. An example of plagiarism in this context is: taking someone's completed analysis published in a blog somewhere and submitting it as your own work. Plagiarism in this course is completely unacceptable and will lead to immediate failing grade for the course and submission to the honor council, regardless of your grade in the other aspects of the course.

**exams:**

This course will have three exams -- two midterms that will occur during class, and a final exam scheduled by the university. The midterms are [tentatively scheduled](course-schedule.md), the [final exam time](https://www.colorado.edu/registrar/students/calendar/finals) has been cemented by the university.

The exams will be entirely pencil-and-paper, no electronics (including calculators). You will be allowed a small set of notes (specifics on this added later). The most important aspect of these notes will be the inputs, outputs, and descriptions of the functions written in your homework.

Exam questions will likely be something like: Achieve a task by do the necessary setup work (e.g., defining an array), "calling" a function, and post-processing the results. It will not be made explicit what function to call -- you will make that judgment based on your understanding of the function inputs, outputs, and limitations.

The final exam will be cumulative.

There may be some additional types of questions, for example: modify the following cod

**email professionalism:**

In the past year, have observed an uptick in emails that, at their core, are attempts to circumvent course policy. I am glad to receive emails from you in general, don't be discouraged to send them to me, but I would like you to think twice before:
- ... sending an email with just "question" (or something similar) in the subject line. See [how to write emails for this class]().
- ... asking me to move deadlines/exams because you have a project or exam in another class.
- ... asking me if there will be a curve.
- ... asking me to accept a late submission without penalty, including if you "forgot" or "thought you had already submitted it".
- ... asking me for extra credit.
- ... asking me when the final is. [It has been scheduled already](https://www.colorado.edu/registrar/students/calendar/finals), and it takes place in the classroom unless you hear otherwise.
- ... asking me to round up your grade.

... or similar requests. This has become a big enough concern that I am implementing the following policy: everyone currently has 0.2% bonus points in the class, but if you send any of the above types of emails, or similar, you lose it. This may not seem like a lot, but FYI I do not round an 89.9% to an A-... I might round an 89.99% but no promises. There has to be a cutoff somewhere, and for a person who has sent only succinct, organized emails all semester, without attempting to circumvent course policy, that cutoff is effectively no higher than 89.8% (once this bonus is added).

If you have an acute medical situation or travel associated with a university-sanctioned team (e.g., CU lacrosse or the Wind Energy Team), please do send the email, promptly.


## Class Disruption

This is a "flipped classroom" that involves discussion between students and computer use. The classroom will be lively -- it is imperative that we remain focused. If you are seen to be checking social media/the news/sports scores, playing games, watching non-course-related videos, listening to music, etc. ... basically if you are using class time for things not related to class ... you will be asked to leave the classroom and your in-class score for the day will be a non-droppable zero. This includes phone use.
:::{caution}
A rough calculation: after dropping a few, your grade on the "in-class" portion of the class will be based on something like 20 in-class problems this semester. A zero on one will drop your overall grade by about 0.5%.

## Late Work

Work submitted after the deadline will be subject to a 50% penalty. However, you may submit 

Computer and internet issues are not a valid excuse for submitting late work. If you would like to "play chicken" with the deadline, then you must accept that might lose. My recommendation is to plan to submit early which will give you a buffer in case you run into trouble. 

Forgetting to submit work does not absolve you from these penalties. "I thought I submitted it" is not going to sway me. Please do not submit timestamps "proving you did it on time" or email me your work after the submission portal is closed in hopes of receiving some credit. You can consider the zero on the assignment to be a penalty for not confirming that your work was submitted.

[Some of the best advice I can give you](../9_readings/success.md) is: get the easy stuff right. Submitting your work on time (and confirming it was submitted) is an example of "the easy stuff". If you are going to do the hard work of completing the assignment, don't mess up the easy work of submitting on time.


## AI Policy

This course allows for [responsible use of AI](../0_details/responsible-AI.md) on homework and projects. AI is prohibited on in-class activities (unless explicitly stated for a specific assignment) and on exams.

The purpose of this policy is to 

"[Responsible use](../0_details/responsible-AI.md)" is a judgment made by the instructional staff and is described in the linked page. Students who are suspected of irresponsible use may be asked to schedule a meeting wherein they will explain their code.

The penalty for AI misuse may include a zero on the assignment, failure of the course, and/or a report to the honor council.

## Final Grade Policy

Students are assessed based on the work that they have submitted over the course of the semester. I cannot and do not take into consideration your intended graduation date, financial aid, sports eligibility,
