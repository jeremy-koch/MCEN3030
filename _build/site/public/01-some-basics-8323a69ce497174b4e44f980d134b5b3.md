# Some Coding Basics

**Author:** Jeremy Koch<sup>1,2</sup> \

## Binary


The code contained on this page is, to a large extent, all that will be needed for the core assignments in this course.

The machine learning project will, of course, require a ton more code, though that project will be more practical. There is an entire course devoted to it.

Remember that, in general, we are not using built-in packages! Yes, there is an ODE solver built-in to MATLAB and scipy and julia. No, you may not use them when writing your Runge-Kutta code

## Creating vectors/matrices/arrays and doing math with them

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} MATLAB
```MATLAB
x=0:0.1:2;
```
:::
:::{tab-item} python
```python
f=lambda x: x**2
```
:::
:::{tab-item} julia
```julia
f=lambda x: x**2
