# The Flipped Classroom

<!-- **Author:** Jeremy Koch -->

## Motivation

I am excited about this semester because we are going to use the "flipped classroom" format for this course. 

My main motivation is this: I have observed an increase in student passivity in the past year or so -- less participation in class, less effort on homework (perhaps enabled by AI), less curiosity... less interest in mechanical engineering! Perhaps this cohort was already going to buck that trend, but I am putting a framework in place that is help, regardless. As much as possible, you will be less of a "spectator" in your own education and will spend more time "doing".

A second motivation is this: I understand that engineering students are busy (don't forget I was once a student too!) and I would like to be as productive as we can in our time together. Traditionally this course required a larger time commitment than . AI use/misuse has made that less true, but 



My goal is to place you in a positive environment and to give you the tools to figure it out. 




Particularly with the emergence of AI, it is 

A third motivation: I think this is going to be highly effective, both in terms of learning the material and in terms of developing ancillary skills like discussion


. In past versions of this class, I spent the first week coding in class, talking about how to write functions . Students followed 
Perhaps the best possible outcome for this class is for everyone to be problem solvers by the end of the semester.

## Organization

Here's how it will look:
- The "lecture content" is 1-3 videos watched before class (so, by Tuesday and Thursday morning). I have gone through great efforts to streamline these videos such that they rarely will exceed 20 minutes, and often will be less than 10. Probably totalling an hour per week.
- We will spend the first few minutes of each class with a very brief summary and questions (in case a good night's rest didn't cause the answers to materialize). The summary will not be a complete rehashing of the videos, and instead will be a reminder of the important equations such that we are all on the same page for the class that day.
- You will be given a problem to be completed collaboratively, submitted in groups of three. An example would be to carry out an algorithm by hand through two iterations. The purpose of this is to help you understand the logic of the algorithm by going through it yourself. Then, more-or-less, you will just need to translate that process into language a computer can understand. Were you mimicking a ```for``` or ```while``` loop?
- The remainder of class will be devoted to getting started on your code in groups -- spiritually, this is office hour time. You may collaborate with colleagues, but everyone writes their own code. You may ask me or the TAs questions. If you are not on-task, you will be asked to leave.
:::{aside}
The same content, delivered in a traditional format, might have taken a whole class period to cover (that is, 2.5 hours per week). This is both a benefit and a drawback: much of each 75-minute class period is devoted to getting the class to quiet down, fighting HDMI cables, making and correcting little mistakes, saying umm... a lot of wasted time that we will mostly avoid. However, a lot of that time is spent on questions from you, which is definitely not a waste of time, and obviously you cannot ask those questions. That is an admitted drawback, but also it could be an opportunity to think on your own (be "active").
:::

So the trade I am offering you (and I guess you are being forced to accept) is 30 minutes of "lecture" time at home for 30 minutes of homework time in "lecture", twice a week. It is a good trade though: that time in class will be very productive because you are collaborating on the problems. I hypothesize that you will need to devote fewer hours to this course than you would if it was in a traditional format.


<!-- ### Benefits

The net effect, I hope, is that you will have a deeper understanding of the content (because you talk about it from many angles with your colleagues) while actually requiring less time overall (when considering class+homework time). If we embrace it, the classroom is going to be full of collaboration and discussion. 

### Pitfalls

If you choose, you may look around on the internet to find extreme opinions on the flipped classroom. I'll go ahead and list the common criticisms here for other classes (I am going to try to avoid all of these):
- It just ends up being more homework. (We will start homework in class.)
- 





Students who just plug in to AI are going to get nothing from this format, and peer-advice like "just plug it into AI" is not allowed (except, maybe, for debugging, but even that is discouraged). 

Attendance is basically required. Show up to class, get the easy stuff right.

You will have to watch videos before each class, and so by definition you have homework for this class at least two nights a week.
