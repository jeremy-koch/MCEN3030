# Programming Basics -- Introduction

One common concern about this course is that it requires you to learn math and a new programming language at the same time. Or at least it did... part of the reason we started offering MCEN 1030 was to deliver more experience in MATLAB/Python. Many of you may have gotten to take that course instead of CSCI 1300. But anyway: I think viewing them as two separate challenges is pessimistic -- the best way to learn to program is to actually do something.

You all know what ```if```, ```for```, and ```while``` do. You know what an array/vector is. You know that you can access the various elements of an array based on their indices. What you may not be certain about is: how exactly does that look in MATLAB/Python/Julia? Should you begin a function with ```function``` or is it something else? Do you have to ```end``` an ```if``` statement? In previous semesters I spent time going through these things in class, with students copying what I wrote and then confirming they get the same output. In retrospect, I am suspicious that this was a waste of time... so passive for students! It probably did not stick! Better will be to dive in and actually start doing things. 

In the first week of this course, you will:
- ... [decide which programming language](languages.md) to use this semester, and [get it going on your machine](installing.md).
- ... explore some tasks using some references I have created about [basic mathematical commands](coding-elements-overview.md).
- ... become familiar with [GitHub](github.md). (Kind of optional... you can integrate it with your coding environment if you want, otherwise can just upload via your web browser.)

Additionally, make sure you have read all the Course Details section, as well as [tips for success](../9_readings/success.md).


Again, I think the best way to learn will be to dive in. Throughout the semester, my goal is to give you the resources and support to do so and succeed. But if you are feeling a bit uncomfortable, no problem -- let's schedule an office hour and we can talk about it.
