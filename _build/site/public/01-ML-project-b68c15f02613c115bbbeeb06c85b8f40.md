# Machine Learning Project (Preview)

**Author:** Jeremy Koch<sup>1,2</sup> \

## Introduction

Machine learning is a topic that we could spend an entire semester on it -- there is indeed a class on it offered by our department in the fall semester. We are going to get a taste of it in this course.



## Some vocabulary

## AI use

If we are devoting only a fraction of a semester to the topic, we are going to need AI assistance! 


## Languages

Python is the preferred language for most data scientists. I can't confirm that it is structurally better than, say, Julia, but there are many more resources available and many more users in the Python community.

Python has 

To be honest, I have never gotten Tensor Flow to work! 

# Requirements

More will likely be added, when the time comes...

- AI use is encouraged for the project. I have used the free versions of LLMs to assist with writing ML code -- you shouldn't have to pay either, though note that if you 
- You cannot feed the . One view of this policy: You will not be able to give proprietary information 
- At various stages you will be asked to submit your prompting history. There are a few reasons we are interested in this, one is this:
