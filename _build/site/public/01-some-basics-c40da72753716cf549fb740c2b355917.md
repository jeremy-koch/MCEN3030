# Some Coding Basics

## Binary


The code contained on this page is, to a large extent, all that will be needed for the core assignments in this course.

The machine learning project will, of course, require a ton more code, though that project will be more practical. There is an entire course devoted to it.

Remember that, in general, we are not using built-in packages! Yes, there is an ODE solver built-in to MATLAB and scipy and julia. No, you may not use them when writing your Runge-Kutta code

## Creating vectors/matrices/arrays

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} MATLAB
```matlab
x1=0:0.1:2;                 % start:step:stop
x2=linspace(0,10,500);      % 500 points between 0 and 10
x3=logspace(4,7,500);       % 500 log-spaced points between 10^4 and 10^7
A=[[1,2,3];[4,5,6]];        % a matrix is an array of arrays, rows separated by ;

y=zeros(1,length(x2));      % a row vector full of zeros with the same length as x2
z=ones(1,length(x2));       % same, but full of ones
A=zeros(4,4);               % a 4x4 matrix of zeros
B=eye(4);                   % diagonal is full of ones, rest zero
D=diag([5,3,1]);            % diagonal is 5,3,1, rest zero
D2=diag([5,3,1],1);         % the first diagonal above the main is [5,3,1]... so this is a 4x4 matrix

r=rand(1,5);                % a row vector with 5 random numbers, uniformly spaced between 0 and 1
R=rand(4,4);                % same, but a 4x4 matrix

## Indexing: Accessing and Modifying Elements

The focus on many debates: should arrays be indexed starting with zero or one? Python indexes starting with 0, MATLAB and Julia index starting with 1.

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} MATLAB
```matlab

x(i)                        % accesses the ith element of x
x(3:)                       % elements 3 to the end
x(:5)                       % the first through fifth elements
x(2:4)                      % the second, third, and fourth elements

A(4,1)                      % fourth element in column 1
A(:,5)                      % the fifth column... a vector
A(4,:)                      % the fourth row

% for all of the above, you can reassign values with =, e.g.
x(3)=5;                     % changes the third element to 5
A(:,5)=0;                   % changes the entire fifth column to 0
```

## Doing math with them






## Conditional Statements


## Loops


## Miscellaneous


## Some common motifs

Don't "hard-code" in numbers if you can avoid it! It will make your code more flexible, readable, and easier to debug. Use ```length(x)``` etc. For example:
::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} MATLAB
```matlab
x=1:100;
y=1:100;
for i=1:100:            
    % are we iterating through x or y?
    % If we have to change whichever of them to 1:500, we'd have to change our "for" line above
end

% this is better
for i=1:length(y):
    % now we know it is iterating through y
    % and if we change to y=1:500, it automatically is ready to go!
end
```
