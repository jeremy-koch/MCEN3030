# AI Policy

**Author:** Jeremy Koch<sup>1,2</sup> \

## 


## A positive thing: 


## Practically...

You have the green-light to use AI on homework and projects in this course. Pencil-and-paper work, including the in-class problems and exams, are technology-free -- no AI.




If I am not going to police AI use, the responsibility shifts to the students.

:::{warning}
Someone will use AI to complete every homework problem in this class and will then fail the exams. 

Another someone will use AI to complete every homework problem and then still aces the exams -- good for you.

Another someone will claim that they "only" used AI to debug, or that they , yet they too will fail the exams. 

Understanding a solution is a VERY different mental process than being able to produce a solution.


There will be no test re-dos, no extra credit, and probably won't be much of a curve. Don't ask.
