## 


## A positive thing: 


## Practically...

You have the green-light to use AI on homework and projects in this course. Pencil-and-paper work, including the in-class problems and exams, are technology-free -- no AI.

:::{warning}
Someone, hopefully not too many someones, will use AI to complete every homework problem in this class and will then fail the exams.

There will also be some students who claim that they . Understanding a solution is a VERY different mental process than being able to produce a solution.


There will be no test re-dos, no extra credit, and probably won't be much of a curve. Don't ask.
